# 👋 Hi, I’m Belkise (Bell)

I'm a **Junior Full Stack Developer** who builds both **web and mobile applications** using **JavaScript**, **React**, **React Native**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TypeScript**. I love creating apps that bring people together - especially tools that support learning, community, communication, or simply entertainment.

- 🧪 Also experienced in QA and testing with **Playwright**, **Jest**, and **Supertest**  
- 🔐 Currently learning: authentication and web security, and desktop development with Electron  
- 🎮 Fun fact: I’m a lifelong gamer and would love to work on game-related or community-based apps  
- 💼 Open to junior roles in **development** or **QA** (manual or automated testing)
