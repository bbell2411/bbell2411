# 👋 Hi, I’m Belkise (Bell)

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** who builds **web and mobile applications** using **JavaScript**, **React**/**Native**, **Node.js**, **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TypeScript**. I love creating apps that bring people together - especially tools that support learning, community, communication, or simply entertainment.

- 🐍 Currently diving deep into **Python** backend development with **Django** and **FastAPI**
- 🧪 Also experienced in QA and testing with **Playwright**, **Jest**, and **Supertest**
- 🤖 Self-teaching **machine learning** with Python as a hobby project
- 🎮 Fun fact: I’m a lifelong gamer and would love to work on game-related or community-based apps
