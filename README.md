- 🔐 Currently learning: authentication and web security, and Blockchain development & Web3 technologies (smart contracts, wallet integration, decentralized apps)
- 🎯 my goal is to master Python frameworks for backend and machine learning.
- 🎮 Fun fact: I’m a lifelong gamer and would love to work on game-related or community-based apps  
- 💼 Open to roles in **development**
